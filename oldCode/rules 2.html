    Games will count no more than a 20-point difference. The difference will be applied to the losing team's score.
    For example, if a game's actual score is 60-30, the game will be recorded as 50-30 (a 20-point difference). 
    Division winners will be determined by the number of wins.

    <!-- Consolidated duplicate defense rule into one -->
    <li>
      Defense â€“ Man-to-man only; no double-teaming away from the ball, and no zone defense. All players on the ball or on the ball side must be closely guarded.
      Players on the weak side may play help-side defense.
      If the referee determines there is intent to play a zone defense or double-team away from the ball, the following penalties shall be assessed:
      on the first offense, play shall be stopped and a warning issued to the coach; on the second and any subsequent offense, the offensive team shall be awarded one free throw and possession at the point of interruption.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may double team the ball - while the game is within 20 points.  No double-teaming the ball with a game score spread bigger then 20.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full-court man-to-man defense is allowed unless the game spread is 20 points or more; in that case, only half-court defense is permitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Halftime will be 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Games are 5-on-5.
    </li>
    <li>
      Games will be played in four 8-minute quarters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Games will be played on a 10-foot hoop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Standard basketball substitutions will be used; no "shift" type substitutions are allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Two timeouts are allowed per half. If the game goes into overtime, only one additional timeout is allowed; no further timeouts will be granted for additional overtime periods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Overtime will consist of two minutes of stop-time play. One timeout is allowed during overtime. At the end of the first overtime, if the score remains tied, the game will proceed to sudden death.
    </li>
    <!-- 
      Note: I noticed that the original file repeated the defense and full-court defense rules.
      I've consolidated them into single entries. Let me know if the duplicate listings were intentional.
